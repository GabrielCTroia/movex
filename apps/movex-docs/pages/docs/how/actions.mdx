# Actions

Actions, like in Redux or Flux are simple commands paired with input that are sent to a reducer in order to compute the next state.

```ts
const myAction = {
  type: 'incrementBy';
  payload: 1;
}
```

## Public Actions

A Public Action, as its name implies is an Action that modifies the shared state (aka the public state), so everyone subscribed to it can get notified and see it.

```ts
const myPublicAction = {
  type: 'incrementBy';
  payload: 2;
  isPrivate: false;
}
```
