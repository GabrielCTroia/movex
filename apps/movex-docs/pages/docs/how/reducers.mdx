# Reducers

A Reducer describes the logic that modifies a Resource State via Actions. Each Resource gets assigned a Reducer in the `movex.config` file.

It is almost the same as a [Redux](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/redux/redux_reducers.htm) or React's `useReducer` reducer, with the difference that it runs both on the front-end and the on back-end, in order to make multi-player mode possible.

> Note: For this to work the Reducer must be [pure](/docs/features/functional#purity)!

### The Reducer Type

```typescript
export type MovexReducer<S = any, A extends AnyAction = AnyAction> = ((
  state: S,
  action: A
) => S) & { $canReconcileState?: (s: S) => boolean };
```

### Example

```ts
// *Api might change

import { Action } from 'movex';

export type CounterState = {
  count: number;
};

export const initialCounterState: CounterState = {
  count: 0,
};

export type CounterActions =
  | Action<'increment'>
  | Action<'decrement'>
  | Action<'incrementBy', number>;

export default (state = initialCounterState, action: CounterActions) => {
  if (action.type === 'increment') {
    return {
      ...state,
      count: state.count + 1,
    };
  }

  if (action.type === 'decrement') {
    return {
      ...state,
      count: state.count - 1,
    };
  }

  if (action.type === 'incrementBy') {
    return {
      ...state,
      count: state.count + action.payload,
    };
  }

  return state;
};
```
