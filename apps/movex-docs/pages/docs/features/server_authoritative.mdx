# Authoritative Server

It's important to keep the app logic outside the reach of potential bad actors, which is why it gets processed on an actual server run by movex. But there is no need for you to code, maintain or worry about that.

Movex makes use of a few concepts and strategies under the hood such as ["Deterministic Action Propagation"](/docs/features/functional#determinstic-action-propagation) as well as running the [`movex.config`](/docs/how/movex_config) logic on both the front-end and the back-end, to make this possible.

Learn more about how Movex works [here](/docs/how).
