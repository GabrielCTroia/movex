# What is Movex?

Movex is a "predictable state container for Javascript Apps", just like it's main inspiration – Redux, but built for applications where the state needs to be shared accross multi-players or multi-peers in a network, just like a turn-based game, a chat application, or anything in between.

Oh, and there is no need to worry about back-end. Really! You just write front-end code using any of the Javascript frameworks or game engines, and Movex will take care of the back-end seamlessly. See more on how [here](/docs/how)!

Movex combines the following features out of the box:

- [x] [Front-end Only](/docs/features/frontend_only)
- [x] [Authoritative Server](/docs/features/server_authoritative)
- [x] [Secret State](/docs/features/secret_state)
- [x] [Realtime Sync](/docs/features/realtime)
- [x] [Typesafe Functional Programming (Redux/Flux API)](/docs/features/functional)
